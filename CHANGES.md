# Future

# 1.8.4
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Prevent crash when Android device is minimized and you go back to the app
- CAMERA/BUGFIX: Fix crash when a core requires the camera driver and the platform only has a null driver. This would crash mgba on Wii for example
- DISK CONTROL: Cycle Disk Tray now becomes Eject Disk or Insert Disk depending upon current drive state
- DISK CONTROL: Current Disk Index is only shown when the current disk has been ejected
- DISK CONTROL: The old Insert Disk entry has been changed to Load New Disk, and is only shown when a disk is currently inserted (this is because loading a new disk from the filesystem - i.e. bypassing the m3u playlist disk index interface - automatically ejects and inserts disks, and so cannot be done while the virtual drive is empty)
- DISK CONTROL: The Current Disk Index may now be set more easily via a drop-down list.
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting Eject Disk automatically moves the menu selection to the Current Disk Index entry
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting an index via the Current Disk Index drop-down list automatically moves the menu selection back to Insert Disk
- DISK CONTROL: The Disk Control entry sublabels have been changed for greater clarity
- DISK CONTROL: All of the horrendous notification spam has been removed. Notifications are now only shown in the event of an error, or when the menu itself does not provide sufficient visual feedback (note that using hotkeys to swap disks still produces the old style notifications, since this is typically only done while content is running - i.e. no menu). The duration of disk-related info notifications has also been reduced to a more sane level.
- DISK CONTROL: A new Resume content after changing disks option has been added under Settings > User Interface. When enabled (default setting), content is resumed automatically after selecting either Insert Disk or Load New Disk (when disabled, the menu remains open, obviously...)
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: The Disk Control menu now has the correct title
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: Selecting a disk via the Load New Disk file browser no longer flushes the user back to the top level menu (it now correctly returns to the Disk Control menu)
- LIBNX/SWITCH: Updated libnx integration to v3.0.0. This also cherry-picks libnx commit 583d6bb92dcbb33b6bb4a0fa1a9df6e3725d6ef6, which should fix the requirement having to turn rumble off and on in the system settings once per reboot

# 1.8.3
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Fix 'Install or Restore Core' regression
- BUGFIX: Ensure core info is always initialised when calling 'drivers_init()'. This bug could prevent cores from doing content runtime logging
- BUGFIX/MENU: History size can only be set to 1 at a minimum

- BUGFIX/CRASH/OPENGL/WINDOWS: Fix regression in 1.8.2 that would cause GL-based cores to fail because it would try to erroneously load libGLESv2.dll instead of OpenGL32.dll (cores affected: VitaQuake 2/3/Dhewm3, possibly more)
- BUGFIX/MENU/DESKTOP UI: Show desktop menu on startup does not launch Qt UI on Linux

- NETPLAY/RELAY: Add Sao Paulo (Brazil) relay server
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Fix the “spectator” bug when using the relay server – When a player switches into the spectator mode (pressing “i”) while using the relay server, all players will disconnect.
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Overall stability has improved. Fixed a memory leak that would cause the relay server to become unresponsive after some time.
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Fixed critical bug that would cause all players to be disconnected from the relay server if one player was leaving the game. That bug had been open for one year and we were finally able to fix it.
- SWITCH/LIBNX/BUGFIX: Fix onscreen keyboard input regression
- THUMBNAIL UPDATER: When waiting for individual thumbnail file http transfers to complete, the task status checking is more accurate. This uses the same method as the new core updater - we now wait until the task is 'really' complete, instead of relying on the (slightly nebulous) 'task finished' state
- UWP: Add ANGLE support
- UWP: Wire up get_metrics to the fake context of D3D9/10/11/12 driver, enabling proper scaling and mouse/touch gestures
- VITA: Re-add Online Updater

- VIDEO FILTERS: Only use threads when the number exceeds 1. Fixes race conditions with some CPU filters on Vita
- WINDOWS: Add ANGLE support for x64, separate binary (for now?)  

# 1.8.2
- BUG/CRASH/GLSLANG: Fix glslang crashing error - managed to reproduce an issue which has been plaguing
users for a while, where glslang throws an assert after closing a game (and starting a new one). This would affect all video drivers that use Slang for shaders, such as D3D10/11/12/Vulkan/Metal

- EMSCRIPTEN: Changes to support upgraded emscripten SDK
- FFMPEG CORE: Hardware accelerated video decoding
- FFMPEG CORE: Implement send/receive encoding API, will allow for hardware accelerated AMD video encoding
- FFMPEG CORE: The video FIFO can be removed, since we have a ring buffer in its place. This removes unneeded copy operations and as a positive side improves overall decoding speed. Makes 8k60p SW and 4k60p HW decoding feasible on many systems. For now the ring buffer is 32 images deep. This limitation will be removed, once audio and video decoder have their own packet handling.
- INPUT: Fix 'Analog stick controls menu even if autoconfig disabled'
- INPUT/TURBO: Added alternate Turbo-Mode 'Single Button' - For systems supporting only a single button, the turbo-button will toggle firing that button without the need to hold it. When holding the button turbo will be suspended and resumed when the button is released. Holding the button may have a different function to just tapping it.

- MENU/USABILITY: Add Audio -> Resampler settings
- MENU/USABILITY: Add Audio -> Output and Audio -> Synchronization
- OPENGL: Shaders are now working properly (only in OpenGL) when rotating both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation. The fix is clearly visible with crt-royale for example
- OPENGL: 1:1 PAR is now correct when rotating (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation, as you said, in the latter case you currently have to change Aspect Ratio after menu video rotation for it to work)
- OPENGL: When using Custom Aspect Ratio and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation), Integer Scaling is now working properly (correct multiples of internal resolution). Even when Integer Scaling is not activated, the Custom AR width / height are now correctly labeled using (1x), (2x), ... suffixes. You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work
- OPENGL: For all other Aspect Ratio options, Integer Scaling and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation) are now working properly together (correct multiples of internal resolution). You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work
- OPENBSD/POWERPC: Should build now on OpenBSD PowerPC

- VITA/VITA2D: Several improvements to Vita 2D driver - menu widgets implemented
- VITA/VITA2D: Fix clipping and reduce number of calls
- VULKAN/ANDROID: Workaround weird WSI return codes in landscape mode -  Android WSI wants you to use preTransform, and if it is not used correctly, Android 10 will return VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR, and we would create a new swapchain every frame. This workaround just ignores this error, since it's not really an error. A more "proper" fix is to use prerotate and modify the MVP matrices,
which might help certain devices with crummy display processors
- VULKAN/ANDROID: Recreate swapchain on orientation change. ANativeWindow getWidth/Height does not detect any changes when using
Vulkan, so use the old onContentRectChanged callback to get notified when size changed. Use those values instead when figuring out how large swapchain to create
- WINDOWS/XINPUT: Get rid of 128 byte device name limit for XInput device discover - when device name was too long, it would not be picked up by the XInput driver and would instead fallback to DirectInput

- MENU/MATERIALUI: Two new context-sensitive buttons have been added to the navigation bar - back button and resume button
- MENU/MATERIALUI: A new Auto-Rotate Navigation Bar option has been added under User Interface > Appearance. When enabled (this is the default setting), the navigation bar is moved to the right hand side of the screen when using landscape screen orientations.
